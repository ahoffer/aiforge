## Model

AGENT_MODEL is set in config.env and k8s/ollama.yaml. Never change the model
without explicit permission from the user.

## Comments

Keep comments concise and terse. Every comment should read like a field note
at an archeology dig: what need drove this code into existence, and how does
this code try to meet that need. Do not describe what the code does
mechanically. Describe the force that shaped it.
